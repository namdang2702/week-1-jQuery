Week 2 Instructions:

Review the basicexample.html and the join.html files. Notice how they rely on javascript to acquire information that is inputted into the form, then they display that information in the DOM.

The task for this week is to recreate the applications you created last week. . . But this week you will not be using "prompts." Instead you will be using methods simiar to those found in basicexample.html and join.html. 

You will create 3 similar applications from scratch.

Please choose from the following challenges.

1. using a form - acquire degrees from two angles of a triangle then determine and display what the third angle should be.

2. using a form - acquire two sides of a right triangle then determine and display what the third side of the right triangle should be.

3. using a form - acquire the cost of a dinner and the percent tip that is to be added then determine and display what the total cost of the meal should be. 

4. using a form - acquire the length and width of a rectangle then determine and display what the area and the perimeter of the rectangle should be. 

Your 3 applications should function similar to how join.html.

When the forms are submitted you should make it such that all of the relevant information along with the computed information are displayed below the form. Similar to how join.html outputs: Hi {name}! The email we have on file for you is:{email}

For each application - write in 4 comments describing what you are doing in a way that is similar to the examples.

Save your work to a repository of your own and pass in a link to it when you are done.
